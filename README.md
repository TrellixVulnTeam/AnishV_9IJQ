# fairbnb

This project was designed to simulate an interactive, web-based hotel booking system.

I coded the back end of this project. It involved the use of Python, Django, and SQL. Python was responsible for the functionality of the various applications used for the website. SQL was used to create and store databases, from which the website extracted and inputted user and system data. The project used django as the web framwork for the website.
